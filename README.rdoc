A Porter is doing fare control. So Porter is an authentication system for Rails 3 applications.

== Installation

* Add Porter to your Rails application's Gemfile. It does require edge rails at the moment.
    gem 'rails',        :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'
    gem 'haml',         :git => 'git://github.com/nex3/haml.git'
    gem 'compass',      :git => 'git://github.com/chriseppstein/compass.git'
    gem 'porter',       :git => 'git://github.com/starpeak/porter.git'
  
* Change into your Rails application's directory

* Generate Porter skeleton
    rails generate porter:skeleton

* Migrate the Porter database tables
    rake porter:db:migrate

== API Documentation

* API Documentation can be created by running 
    rake rdoc
  from the porter project directory.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. No discussion. No tests, no game. We use rspec and cucumber with associated addons.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, thats fine. But bump your version in a seperate commit that can be ignored when pulling.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
